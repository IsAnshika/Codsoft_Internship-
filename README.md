During my internship as a Data Science Intern, I successfully completed three key projects. First, I worked on the Titanic Survival Prediction dataset, where I built and evaluated a model to predict passenger survival chances. Second, I analyzed the IMDb Movie Rating dataset, focusing on data cleaning, visualization, and exploring movie ratings. Lastly, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Iris Flower dataset, including exploratory data analysis, visualization, and building a classification model. These projects enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning.
1. Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset: Developed a predictive model to estimate the survival likelihood of passengers on the Titanic. This involved preprocessing the data, handling missing values, feature engineering, and training a logistic regression model to make accurate predictions.

2. IMDb Movie Rating Dataset: Analyzed a dataset of movie ratings from IMDb, focusing on data cleaning and visualization. Created visualizations to explore movie rating trends, genre distributions, and other insights to understand the dataset's characteristics and quality.

3. Iris Flower Dataset: Performed exploratory data analysis and built a classification model using the Iris dataset. This included data visualization to identify patterns and relationships, preprocessing steps to prepare the data, and applying machine learning techniques to classify different species of iris flowers.
